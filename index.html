                    My name is Angelo Dinong, and I am currently a student at Tarlac Agricultural University, pursuing a degree in Information Technology. As part of my program, I’m taking ITEC 23 – Social and Professional Issues in Information Technology, a course that focuses on the ethical, legal, and societal aspects of working in the IT field. Coming from a background where I’ve seen how quickly technology is changing our daily lives, I was eager to explore how these changes raise important questions about responsibility, privacy, and professionalism in the tech world.

                <p data-aos="fade-up">I was particularly interested in this course because it goes beyond technical skills and dives into real-world issues that IT professionals face today. Topics like cybersecurity, ethical hacking, digital privacy, and professional conduct really stood out to me. They made me reflect on how important it is to balance innovation with ethical responsibility. In a field that constantly pushes the boundaries of what’s possible, it’s easy to forget that behind every line of code or system we build, there are real people who will be affected by our decisions. This course has helped me understand that being a good IT professional means more than just knowing how to write programs—it also means acting with integrity and being accountable for the impact of our work.</p>

            <div class="column large-12 w-900-stack s-about__intro-text">
                <p data-aos="fade-up">As the world becomes more dependent on technology, the lessons I’m learning in ITEC 23 feel more important than ever. Technology is now at the center of communication, business, healthcare, and education, which means that even small missteps can have serious consequences. This course has shown me the value of having strong ethical frameworks and professional standards in place to guide our work. It’s made me realize that trust, fairness, and responsibility are just as important as technical skills in this field. I now feel more aware and better prepared to face the challenges and responsibilities that come with a career in Information Technology.</p>

                    The event in focus is the Social Media Data Harvesting Scandal, which came to light in 2018 and sent shockwaves through the tech industry and beyond.
                </p>

                <h3 class="item-title">Who:</h3>
                <p>
                    This incident involved a major social media platform and a third-party app developer, who collaborated to collect personal data from millions of users without obtaining clear, explicit consent, violating user trust on a massive scale.
                </p>

            <div class="column item item-process" data-aos="fade-up">
                <h3 class="item-title">When:</h3>
                <p >
                    The issue was publicly exposed in March 2018, though the questionable data collection practices had been occurring over several years, primarily between 2014 and 2016, without adequate oversight or user notification.

            <div class="column item item-process" data-aos="fade-up">
                <h3 class="item-title">Impact:</h3>
                <p>
                    As a result, the personal data of over 50 million users was improperly harvested and subsequently used for targeted political advertising, which influenced elections and eroded public trust in both the social media platform and the broader technology sector.

                </h4><br>
                <p data-aos="fade-up">
                    This scandal brought to the forefront a range of significant ethical concerns that continue to resonate in the tech world. A massive breach of privacy occurred when the social media platform and the app developer collected and shared user data without obtaining explicit, informed consent, violating a fundamental principle of user rights. Furthermore, the misuse of this data fueled the spread of misinformation, as it was leveraged to manipulate public opinion during critical political processes, such as elections, thereby threatening the integrity of democratic systems. Both the platform and the developer failed to uphold their responsibility to prioritize user rights, resulting in widespread distrust in technology companies and raising questions about accountability in the digital age.

                <p >
                    From a deontological perspective, a clear duty to protect user data and secure informed consent before any collection or use was blatantly violated in this case. The social media platform and the third-party developer disregarded their ethical obligation to respect user autonomy, choosing instead to prioritize financial and strategic gains over the rights and well-being of their users.

                <p>
                    When viewed through a utilitarian lens, the outcome of this scandal caused significant harm to millions of users, as the misuse of their data undermined public trust in technology and compromised the fairness of democratic processes, far outweighing any short-term benefits the companies may have gained from their actions.

                <p >
                    Governments and regulatory bodies should enforce stricter data privacy laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, which mandate that companies obtain explicit, informed user consent before collecting, processing, or sharing any personal data, ensuring greater accountability.

                <p>
                    Technology companies must take proactive steps to limit third-party app access to user data, implement robust encryption standards, and conduct regular, thorough privacy audits to identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

                <p>
                    Throughout ITEC 23, I encountered a range of complex ethical dilemmas that challenged my thinking, such as the tension between collecting user data to drive technological innovation and the fundamental right to privacy that all individuals deserve. One particularly striking case involved analyzing a data breach where a company neglected to encrypt sensitive user information, resulting in widespread identity theft and significant harm to affected individuals. From this, I learned that negligence in implementing basic security practices not only shatters user trust but also leads to tangible, often devastating consequences for victims, including financial loss and emotional distress. Another compelling dilemma we explored was the use of artificial intelligence in surveillance systems, which raised questions about balancing legitimate security needs with the protection of individual freedoms and privacy rights.

                <p>
                    These experiences profoundly shaped my approach to ethical reasoning, highlighting the critical importance of accountability and the need for proactive safeguards in all aspects of technology development. I now place a high priority on transparency with users and ensuring informed consent is obtained before any data is collected or processed. Looking ahead to my future career in IT, I plan to apply these insights by actively advocating for the implementation of robust security protocols, such as encryption and multi-factor authentication, and by promoting ethical decision-making that places user well-being at the forefront. My goal is to ensure that technology serves humanity in a responsible, equitable, and trustworthy manner, contributing positively to society.<br>

                    "Ethics in IT is not just a guideline—it’s a commitment to protect and empower users in every decision we make as professionals."
